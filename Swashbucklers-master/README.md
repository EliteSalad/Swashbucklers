# Swashbucklers

This game was developed as part of my University course to demonstrate my ability to develop android games to a professional standard.

The original repository was unfortunately deleted some time ago however I was able to salvage the files and upload them to this repo.

The game was developed in Unity over roughly a 3 month period.
